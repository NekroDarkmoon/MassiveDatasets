* use this languages.csv file

  the languages.csv file contains two mistakes. Please use this one instead
  languages.csv


* sbt to use with spark.

  I have created an sbt file for spark that you has the dependencies for spark.ml

* Sample of the files to create

There are 2 files here with samples of users and their corresponding baskets, for both formats.

  baskets.sample
  documents.sample

you can create these files using the script   test-sample.sh.

Assuming your files are claled baskets.csv and documents.data, run:


#+begin_src sh
test-sample.sh baskets.csv
#+end_src

and 

#+begin_src sh
test-sample.sh documents.data
#+end_src
